This is my first website that I made with the help of Brian Design on YouTube. He is a great teacher and I followed along using this video: https://youtu.be/VegDvRLVlOI?si=8tqoHU-JEr-MhLQ3.
I also had the help of SuperSimpleDev on YouTube to help create a github account and add my files in here. The follwing video helped me: https://youtu.be/p1QU3kLFPdg?si=3tpUkhEsDMZibE-Q.

I then used AWS to host my website and connect it to an RDS database for my 2048 game leaderboard.
