        <p>
          Hi, I’m Anthony! I’m currently an AI Processing Technician at ALERTWest, where I play a key role in helping detect and confirm wildfires. 
          It’s incredible to know that the work I do directly impacts safety and helps protect communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m passionate about technology and data. 
          At work, I’ve had the chance to create tools like a Power BI dashboard that’s been a game-changer for our stakeholders. 
          I love finding ways to make processes more efficient, whether it’s automating tasks, integrating APIs, or developing creative solutions to complex problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills—whether it’s building fun web projects, 
          experimenting with new coding techniques, or diving deeper into data analytics. 
          My dream is to keep growing and use my skills to make a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making.
        </p>
